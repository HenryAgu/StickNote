### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Reactjs (Hooks)

## What I Learnt on the project
    I learnt to use local storage to retain the notes(texts) entered into the input tag, so even when the page is reloaded the information will be retained.

```js

  const [notes, setNotes] = useLocalStorage('notes',[]);

```

## Roadmap
- When the page loads, enter a note of not more than 150 words and then click the button beneath.

- To delete the note, click the thrash icon on the cards that appears under with the note.

- To edit click the pencil icon, then the content appears back on the input box above, then you can edit it and resubmit BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO DELETE THE OLD NOTE.
